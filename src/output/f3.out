Before attending lecture, study the lecture slides and code, following along with the animations. Pay special attention to the precise terminology, for example, the differences between "operand", "argument", and "parameter". More importantly, when presented with an example, try to predict each next step that will happen before moving on. Then, once you've settled on your answer, verify that the answer is correct. If the answer isn't correct, try to learn why it was not correct. Was there a misunderstanding of the definitions? Was there a misconception in how you applied the definition? Basically, our goal is to identify our weak spots and places where we need to spend more time with a concept.

Consult the readings, watch past webcasted lectures, try things out in the interpreter, or ask your friends to help answer the questions and misconceptions you identified.
In lecture, do not copy down the slides. Instead, spend the lecture focusing on the points that were confusing and pay close attention to the details that matter to you. Try to answer the questions you came up with since there are usually a couple more details presented in live lecture. This is also a good opportunity to ask your questions directly since it's likely that many other students have the very same question.
Participate in discussion, lab, and group mentoring. These are all opportunities for a staff member to address your questions, oftentimes without you even needing to ask it! Focus on coming up with generalizable strategies to solving problems. What are the steps that are needed to solve a problem like this from scratch? How does your section leader break things down? From which direction do they start approaching the problem? The goal is to further develop and hone your intuition about these problems.
If it still doesn't make sense, attend office hours and one-on-one tutoring.
Since we're all busy people, here's a more realistic schedule combining steps 1, 2, and 3 from the ideal workflow. We won't have time to prepare before lecture, so instead, try to anticipate each next step during lecture. Because we're busy thinking, we don't spend time taking detailed notes. Instead, record questions or misconceptions that you came up with. Compare your thought process with the walkthroughs presented by the instructor. Where do you diverge? Take note of that and, if it's still confusing, remember to address it later. Then, participate in all other course activities following the same steps above.

Instead, record questions or misconceptions that you came up with. Compare your thought process with the walkthroughs presented by the instructor. Where do you diverge? Take note of that and, if it's still confusing, remember to address it later. Then, participate in all other course activities following the same steps above.
Consult the readings, watch past webcasted lectures, try things out in the interpreter, or ask your friends to help answer the questions and misconceptions you identified.
In lecture, do not copy down the slides. Instead, spend the lecture focusing on the points that were confusing and pay close attention to the details that matter to you. Try to answer the questions you came up with since there are usually a couple more details presented in live lecture. This is also a good opportunity to ask your questions directly since it's likely that many other students have the very same question.
Participate in discussion, lab, and group mentoring. These are all opportunities for a staff member to address your questions, oftentimes without you even needing to ask it! Focus on coming up with generalizable strategies to solving problems. What are the steps that are needed to solve a problem like this from scratch? How does your section leader break things down? From which direction do they start approaching the problem? The goal is to further develop and hone your intuition about these problems.
If it still doesn't make sense, attend office hours and one-on-one tutoring.

Before attending lecture, study the lecture slides and code, following along with the animations. Pay special attention to the precise terminology, for example, the differences between "operand", "argument", and "parameter". More importantly, when presented with an example, try to predict each next step that will happen before moving on. Then, once you've settled on your answer, verify that the answer is correct. If the answer isn't correct, try to learn why it was not correct. Was there a misunderstanding of the definitions? Was there a misconception in how you applied the definition? Basically, our goal is to identify our weak spots and places where we need to spend more time with a concept.

Basically, our goal is to identify our weak spots and places where we need to spend more time with a concept.
Before attending lecture, study the lecture slides and code, following along with the animations. Pay special attention to the precise terminology, for example, the differences between "operand", "argument", and "parameter". More importantly, when presented with an example, try to predict each next step that will happen before moving on. Then, once you've settled on your answer, verify that the answer is correct. If the answer isn't correct, try to learn why it was not correct. Was there a misunderstanding of the definitions? Was there a misconception in how you applied the definition?

Consult the readings, watch past webcasted lectures, try things out in the interpreter, or ask your friends to help answer the questions and misconceptions you identified.
In lecture, do not copy down the slides. Instead, spend the lecture focusing on the points that were confusing and pay close attention to the details that matter to you. Try to answer the questions you came up with since there are usually a couple more details presented in live lecture. This is also a good opportunity to ask your questions directly since it's likely that many other students have the very same question.
Participate in discussion, lab, and group mentoring. These are all opportunities for a staff member to address your questions, oftentimes without you even needing to ask it! Focus on coming up with generalizable strategies to solving problems. What are the steps that are needed to solve a problem like this from scratch? How does your section leader break things down? From which direction do they start approaching the problem? The goal is to further develop and hone your intuition about these problems.
If it still doesn't make sense, attend office hours and one-on-one tutoring.
Since we're all busy people, here's a more realistic schedule combining steps 1, 2, and 3 from the ideal workflow. We won't have time to prepare before lecture, so instead, try to anticipate each next step during lecture. Because we're busy thinking, we don't spend time taking detailed notes. Instead, record questions or misconceptions that you came up with. Compare your thought process with the walkthroughs presented by the instructor. Where do you diverge? Take note of that and, if it's still confusing, remember to address it later. Then, participate in all other course activities following the same steps above.

Since we're all busy people, here's a more realistic schedule combining steps 1, 2, and 3 from the ideal workflow. We won't have time to prepare before lecture, so instead, try to anticipate each next step during lecture. Because we're busy thinking, we don't spend time taking detailed notes. Instead, record questions or misconceptions that you came up with. Compare your thought process with the walkthroughs presented by the instructor. Where do you diverge? Take note of that and, if it's still confusing, remember to address it later. Then, participate in all other course activities following the same steps above.
Consult the readings, watch past webcasted lectures, try things out in the interpreter, or ask your friends to help answer the questions and misconceptions you identified.
In lecture, do not copy down the slides. Instead, spend the lecture focusing on the points that were confusing and pay close attention to the details that matter to you. Try to answer the questions you came up with since there are usually a couple more details presented in live lecture.

Participate in discussion, lab, and group mentoring. These are all opportunities for a staff member to address your questions, oftentimes without you even needing to ask it! Focus on coming up with generalizable strategies to solving problems. What are the steps that are needed to solve a problem like this from scratch? How does your section leader break things down? From which direction do they start approaching the problem? The goal is to further develop and hone your intuition about these problems.

Before attending lecture, study the lecture slides and code, following along with the animations. Pay special attention to the precise terminology, for example, the differences between "operand", "argument", and "parameter". More importantly, when presented with an example, try to predict each next step that will happen before moving on. Then, once you've settled on your answer, verify that the answer is correct. If the answer isn't correct, try to learn why it was not correct. Was there a misunderstanding of the definitions? Was there a misconception in how you applied the definition? Basically, our goal is to identify our weak spots and places where we need to spend more time with a concept.

Focus on coming up with generalizable strategies to solving problems. What are the steps that are needed to solve a problem like this from scratch? How does your section leader break things down? From which direction do they start approaching the problem? The goal is to further develop and hone your intuition about these problems.
If it still doesn't make sense, attend office hours and one-on-one tutoring.
Since we're all busy people, here's a more realistic schedule combining steps 1, 2, and 3 from the ideal workflow. We won't have time to prepare before lecture, so instead, try to anticipate each next step during lecture. Because we're busy thinking, we don't spend time taking detailed notes. Instead, record questions or misconceptions that you came up with. Compare your thought process with the walkthroughs presented by the instructor. Where do you diverge? Take note of that and, if it's still confusing, remember to address it later. Then, participate in all other course activities following the same steps above.

Try to answer the questions you came up with since there are usually a couple more details presented in live lecture. This is also a good opportunity to ask your questions directly since it's likely that many other students have the very same question.
Participate in discussion, lab, and group mentoring. These are all opportunities for a staff member to address your questions, oftentimes without you even needing to ask it! Focus on coming up with generalizable strategies to solving problems. What are the steps that are needed to solve a problem like this from scratch? How does your section leader break things down? From which direction do they start approaching the problem? The goal is to further develop and hone your intuition about these problems.
If it still doesn't make sense, attend office hours and one-on-one tutoring.
Since we're all busy people, here's a more realistic schedule combining steps 1, 2, and 3 from the ideal workflow. We won't have time to prepare before lecture, so instead, try to anticipate each next step during lecture. Because we're busy thinking, we don't spend time taking detailed notes. Instead, record questions or misconceptions that you came up with. Compare your thought process with the walkthroughs presented by the instructor. Where do you diverge? Take note of that and, if it's still confusing, remember to address it later. Then, participate in all other course activities following the same steps above.

Before attending lecture, study the lecture slides and code, following along with the animations. Pay special attention to the precise terminology, for example, the differences between "operand", "argument", and "parameter". More importantly, when presented with an example, try to predict each next step that will happen before moving on. Then, once you've settled on your answer, verify that the answer is correct. If the answer isn't correct, try to learn why it was not correct. Was there a misunderstanding of the definitions? Was there a misconception in how you applied the definition? Basically, our goal is to identify our weak spots and places where we need to spend more time with a concept.

Consult the readings, watch past webcasted lectures, try things out in the interpreter, or ask your friends to help answer the questions and misconceptions you identified.
In lecture, do not copy down the slides. Instead, spend the lecture focusing on the points that were confusing and pay close attention to the details that matter to you. Try to answer the questions you came up with since there are usually a couple more details presented in live lecture. This is also a good opportunity to ask your questions directly since it's likely that many other students have the very same question.
Participate in discussion, lab, and group mentoring. These are all opportunities for a staff member to address your questions, oftentimes without you even needing to ask it! Focus on coming up with generalizable strategies to solving problems. What are the steps that are needed to solve a problem like this from scratch? How does your section leader break things down? From which direction do they start approaching the problem? The goal is to further develop and hone your intuition about these problems.
If it still doesn't make sense, attend office hours and one-on-one tutoring.
Since we're all busy people, here's a more realistic schedule combining steps 1, 2, and 3 from the ideal workflow. We won't have time to prepare before lecture, so instead, try to anticipate each next step during lecture. Because we're busy thinking, we don't spend time taking detailed notes. Instead, record questions or misconceptions that you came up with. Compare your thought process with the walkthroughs presented by the instructor. Where do you diverge? Take note of that and, if it's still confusing, remember to address it later. Then, participate in all other course activities following the same steps above.
